## üß™ Strategies
### Buy-and-Hold
A simple strategy which buys a stock at a specific date (the start date) and sells it at another specified date (the end date). It's useful for testing other strategies.<br>

### Moving Average Crossover
This strategy combines a short-term moving average with a long-term moving average. If the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, this indicates a bullish market, so we buy. If the short-term average is less, we sell.<br>

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
This is a widley used trading strategy. We once again take two moving averages, a long and a short, and take the moving average of those two moving averages, this gives us the MACD line. Then we take a moving average of the MACD line, this is the signal line. <br>

We can measure if the MACD line is above the Signal line, we want to be in a buy position, if the opposite is true, we want to be in a sell position.<br>

### MACD+
This is a project of mine where I am trying to build an improved version of the MACD strategy, however, it is not yet complete.
