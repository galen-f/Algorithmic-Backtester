## üß™ Strategies
### Buy-and-Hold
A simple strategy which buys a stock at a specific date (the start date) and sells it at another specified date (the end date). It's useful for testing other strategies.<br>

### Moving Average Crossover
This strategy combines a short-term moving average with a long-term moving average. If the short-term moving average is greater than the long-term moving average, this indicates a bullish market, so we buy. If the short-term average is less, we sell.<br>

### Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
This is a widley used trading strategy. We once again take two moving averages, a long and a short, and take the moving average of those two moving averages, this gives us the MACD line. Then we take a moving average of the MACD line, this is the signal line. <br>

We can measure if the MACD line is above the Signal line, we want to be in a buy position, if the opposite is true, we want to be in a sell position.<br>

### MACD+
An adjustment of the MACD strategy which includes more trend indicators, such as only buying if the MACD line is negative (undervalued) and the stock is above a 200 day EMA (Uptrend). Often too cautious to be profitable, but good at reducing losses in downtrending markets. <br>

### Agressive MACD
A further adjustment of the cautious MACD which attempts in increase the agressivness of the algorithm. Very profitable in bull markets but very vulnerable in bear markets. Increases the aggression by only selling when the downwards momentum is significant and below the 200 day EMA. <br>
